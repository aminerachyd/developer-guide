# Starter Kits

!!!Todo
    Complete an overview of what starter kits are and what starter kits are provided by the Toolkit

    There should be a page for each starter kit provided by the Toolkit, and the page should have a link to the adopting the toolkit section use case for each starter kit.  
    
    The reference section describes what is in the toolkit, what tool configuration is provided by the toolkit (e.g. a static analysis tool configuration file) and any configuration options or customizations a developer may need to make.  
    
    The use-cases section within Adopting the toolkit should explain how to use the toolkit.
