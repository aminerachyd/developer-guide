# Iteration Zero

Iteration Zero is the name of the process of installing and setting up the toolkit.  

The toolkit uses [infrastructure as code](../../adopting/best-practices/infrastructure-as-code.md){: target=_blank} using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io){: target=_blank} as the primary means of coordinating and performing the many component installs needed by the toolkit.

The fast-start install uses all the default values provided by the modules to deliver a generic install of the Toolkit, but as you adopt the Toolkit you may want to customize the Toolkit install process.
