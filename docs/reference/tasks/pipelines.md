# Pipelines

!!!Todo
    Is there anything to do for Jenkins pipelines here?

The toolkit provides a number of pipelines for a number of programming languages.

!!!Todo
    Add a breakdown of the pipelines and tasks provided by the Toolkit.  Each pipeline and task should have a separate reference page.  

    Also add a link to the adopting section discussing adding a new use case ../../adopting/use-cases/adding-new-usecase.md
