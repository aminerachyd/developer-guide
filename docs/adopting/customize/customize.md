# Customizing the Toolkit installation

!!!Todo
    This section needs to be completed.

    The aim of this section is to explain the customization options available within the toolkit.  THis includes different options for installation and selecting and configuring the content delivered within the toolkit
    
    Content about adding new capabilities to the toolkit should not be added here.  How to extend the toolkit is covered under the [use cases section](../use-cases/add-use-case.md)

    The Reference section contains reference information about each component of the toolkit - it should not be added here:
    
      - Components supported by the toolkit.  How they function within the toolkit
          - ConfigMaps, Secrets, CRD created for the component
          - Any specific customizations, config the toolkit adds for enable a component
      - Terraform modules available and details of what each module does
      - Pipelines and Tasks installed and details of what each module does

    This content should reference the iteration zero reference section, where each Terraform module will be described
    
    There is content within the original site documentation, but it may need updating:

    - [https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/admin/cluster-configuration](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/admin/cluster-configuration)
    - [https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/admin/terraform](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/admin/terraform)

!!!Todo
    This section talks about options to move away from the *standard* install

    - switch components (e.g. Jenkins instead of Tekton/OpenShift Pipelines)
    - platform specific components (e.g. IBM Cloud Pak)
