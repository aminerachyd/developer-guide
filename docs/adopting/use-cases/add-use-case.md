# Adding a new use case

You may want to extend the capabilities of the toolkit to provide additional functionality, such as adding support for a new programming language or use additional tooling.  When adding a new use case there are the areas you need to consider:

- create a new starter kit or update an existing one to ensure developers can efficiently use the use case?
- add or amend pipelines or pipeline tasks?
- add dashboard and console links (to make use case available to developers)
