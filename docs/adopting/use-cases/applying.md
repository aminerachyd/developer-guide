    The reference section describes what is in the toolkit, what tool configuration is provided by the toolkit (e.g. a static analysis tool configuration file) and any configuration options or customizations a developer may need to make.
    
    The use-cases section within Adopting the toolkit should explain how to use the toolkit.
