# Introduction to IBM Cloud Shell

IBM Cloud Shell is a free service that gives you complete control of your cloud resources, applications, and
infrastructure, from any web browser. It's instantly accessible from your free IBM Cloud account--no other installation
is needed.

Features of IBM Cloud Shell include:

- Preconfigured environment: IBM Cloud Shell provides a curated, cloud-based workspace with dozens of preinstalled tools
  and programming languages. It's automatically authenticated with your IBM Cloud account so you can start to develop
  immediately.

- File upload/download: use this feature to import files to IBM Cloud Shell or pull-down data to your local machine.

- Multiple sessions: use up to five shell sessions at a time to maximize your productivity. Mirror workflows on your
  local machine, or view logs on one session while editing a file in another.

## Accessing the Cloud Shell

- Open the IBM Cloud console (cloud.ibm.com) in your browser and log in if needed.

- Invoke Cloud Shell by clicking on the button at the top, right-hand corner of the browser window.
